This is a project from a course I bought on Udemy "The complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr Angela Yu.
Each button you see on your screen has a specific sound attached to it on click or keypress
If you enjoy playing drums, this is a cool leisure for you!


I used this project to gain more knowledge on JavaScript.


The HTML section was simple, a page with a h1, a div with 7 buttons that contains only letters and my footer


The CSS part was also a simple one, gave specific color to my page, and different fontsize and font family for different sections i.e h1, div, and footer
I also used the css to give each buttons contained in the div a specific background image according to the sound i intend to attach to the button
I created a class of pressed that i would apply later using JavaScript
No framework was used on this project


I applied some knowledge from my learning in the JavaSript page, i was able to get the buttons and add an event listener to check for click and also keyboard event for specific keys displayed on the buttons
The i created a function and with the aid of the switch statement, could play sounds when an event happens
using JavaScript, i added the pressed class on the buttons when an event happens, and used the setTimeOut function to remove the class after 1 second
